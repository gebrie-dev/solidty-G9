Message Calls
Sending value and calldata to contracts involves message calls.

The first message call initiates the transaction.
Each subsequent message call is part of the same transaction (contract-to-contract).
The transaction and any state changes only complete when the initial function call finishes execution.
How Do EOAs and Contracts Call Other Contracts?
Using the Address: Both EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) and contracts use the address of the contract they want to communicate with. This address is a 20-byte data type in Solidity.
The msg.sender: From the previous discussions, the msg.sender is an address representing the caller of the function.
