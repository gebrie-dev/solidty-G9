Let's build an escrow agreement between two parties to transfer some value, arbitrated by a third party.
Understanding Escrow
An escrow is a secure financial arrangement where a neutral third party holds funds until the terms of a transaction are met. This setup ensures that both parties fulfill their obligations before the transaction is completed, adding a layer of trust and security.

Key Components
Participants:

Buyer: The party purchasing goods or services and depositing funds into the escrow.
Seller: The party providing goods or services and receiving funds from the escrow.
Arbitrator: A neutral third party who resolves disputes and authorizes the release of funds.

Functionality

Deposit Funds: The buyer deposits the agreed amount into the escrow contract.
Confirm Delivery: The buyer confirms receipt of the goods or services.
Release Funds: The arbitrator releases the funds to the seller upon delivery confirmation.
Dispute Resolution: The arbitrator resolves disputes if the buyer and seller disagree.
