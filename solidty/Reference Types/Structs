Structs
Structs in Solidity are a powerful way to group variables under a single name, providing a clear and organized structure to manage related data.

Key Characteristics:
Grouped Variables: Structs allow you to group multiple variables under a single name, making your code more organized and easier to manage.
Flexible Storage Locations: Structs can be stored in different data locations, such as storage, memory, and calldata, depending on the use case.
Nested Structures: Structs can be nested within other structs, arrays, or mappings, enabling complex data structures.
