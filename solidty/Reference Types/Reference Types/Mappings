Mappings
Mappings in Solidity are a key/value hash lookup, providing a way to associate unique keys with specific values.

Key Characteristics:
Key/Value Lookup: Mappings are used to store key/value pairs, allowing for efficient data retrieval.
Storage Read-Only: Mappings are always stored in storage and are read-only.
Not Passable as Arguments: Mappings cannot be passed directly as arguments to functions.
Combining Types:
Nested Mappings: You can nest mappings within other mappings, structs, or arrays. However, it's important to be cautious with nested mappings within structs, as they can add complexity to your contract's logic and storage management.
Example 
Address Balances: Storing user balances by associating addresses with balance values.
Access Control: Managing permissions by mapping addresses to access roles or levels.
